> **Local private build:** remote licensing and telemetry have been removed from this checkout. This build uses Evolution Go; original license, notices and frontend branding are retained. See [Private self-hosting](./SELF_HOSTING.md) for the deployment entry point and network boundaries. The upstream prebuilt binary was removed; do not restore it or use upstream container images.

## About

**Evolution Go** is a high-performance WhatsApp API built in Go. Part of the Evolution Foundation ecosystem, it provides a robust, lightweight solution for WhatsApp integration using the [whatsmeow](https://github.com/tulir/whatsmeow) library.

## Part of the Evolution Foundation ecosystem

Evolution Go is one of the messaging engines maintained by Evolution Foundation. It is used as a WhatsApp provider by the [Evo CRM Community](https://github.com/evolution-foundation/evo-crm-community) and other projects in the ecosystem.

---

## Features

- **High performance** — built with Go for minimal resource usage
- **RESTful API** — clean, well-documented REST endpoints with Swagger
- **Real-time events** — WebSocket, Webhook, AMQP/RabbitMQ and NATS support
- **Media support** — images, videos, audio, documents with MinIO/S3 storage
- **Message storage** — optional PostgreSQL persistence
- **QR code pairing** — built-in QR code generation for device linking
- **Private runtime** — no remote registration, activation, heartbeat or telemetry
- **Docker ready** — production-ready Docker configuration

---

## Quick Start

### Docker (recommended)

Run from this modified checkout, not a fresh clone of the upstream project.

```bash
cd /path/to/this/checkout
./scripts/setup-private.sh
docker compose --env-file .env.private -f compose.private.yml up -d --build
```

### Local development

```bash
cd /path/to/this/checkout

# Setup, configure and run
make setup
cp .env.example .env
make dev
```

> Run `make help` to see all available commands. See [COMMANDS.md](./COMMANDS.md) for detailed workflows.

---

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file:

```env
# Server
SERVER_PORT=8080
CLIENT_NAME=evolution

# Security
GLOBAL_API_KEY=your-secure-api-key-here

# Database
POSTGRES_AUTH_DB=postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/evogo_auth?sslmode=disable
POSTGRES_USERS_DB=postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/evogo_users?sslmode=disable
DATABASE_SAVE_MESSAGES=false

# Logging
DEBUG_ENABLED=0
LOG_TYPE=console

# Optional
# AMQP_URL=amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672/
# NATS_URL=nats://localhost:4222
# WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-webhook-url.com/webhook
# MINIO_ENABLED=true
# MINIO_ENDPOINT=localhost:9000
# MINIO_ACCESS_KEY=minioadmin
# MINIO_SECRET_KEY=minioadmin
```

| Variable | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `SERVER_PORT` | Server port | `8080` |
| `CLIENT_NAME` | Client identifier | `evolution` |
| `GLOBAL_API_KEY` | API authentication key | **Required** |
| `DATABASE_SAVE_MESSAGES` | Enable message storage | `false` |
| `WADEBUG` | WhatsApp debug level | `INFO` |

---

## Local runtime

This modified build starts without contacting a licensing service. The bundled
Manager uses local compatibility endpoints; API authentication is still required.
No email, registration or first-time online activation is needed.

Use [SELF_HOSTING.md](./SELF_HOSTING.md) and compose.private.yml to deploy this
source tree. The original LICENSE and NOTICE still apply.

## API Documentation

Swagger UI available at:

```
http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html
```

### Key Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/instance/create` | Create WhatsApp instance |
| `GET` | `/instance/{name}/qrcode` | Get QR code for pairing |
| `POST` | `/message/sendText` | Send text message |
| `POST` | `/message/sendMedia` | Send media message |
| `GET` | `/instance/{name}/status` | Get instance status |
| `DELETE` | `/instance/{name}` | Delete instance |

## Telemetry

This modified build sends no Evolution telemetry or licensing requests. Application HTTP integrations are loopback-only unless explicitly allowlisted; WhatsApp connections remain necessary. See [SELF_HOSTING.md](./SELF_HOSTING.md) for scope, configuration and verification.

### Private multi-device history (opt-in)

Set `PRIVATE_CHAT_HISTORY=true` to persist credential-free Message, SendMessage, Receipt and
HistorySync events in PostgreSQL for offline desktop catch-up. `GET /chat/events?after=ID`
uses the instance token and scopes every page to that instance and full paired device JID.
IDs are strings; save the returned `nextCursor` only after persisting the whole page and
continue while `hasMore` is true. Reads work offline and never start a WhatsApp session.
This is separate from `DATABASE_SAVE_MESSAGES`, which stores only legacy status metadata.
The journal contains message content and media descriptors, not downloaded media bytes;
there is no automatic expiration, so include it in private backups and plan retention.

`POST /chat/history-recover` accepts `{"chat":"JID","messageIds":["KNOWN_ID"]}` for up to
50 message IDs already associated with the authenticated device and chat. It requests the
messages only from the account's own primary phone; results arrive asynchronously as Message
events and enter the journal. It never sends to the contact. The phone must be online and
still retain the message. Recovery requests are not safe to retry blindly.
